# Executive Summary
* Summarize this assignment and the goal of this lab
* After this assignment, you will gain knowledge of hexadecimal color representation, logic gates and circuits, as well as IEEE.

# Hexadecimal color representation
* Explain the representation: #ab00ff using the site: https://www.colorhexa.com/
* The representation of #ab00ff is pure violet or mostly pure violet. In a RGB color space is 67.1% red, 0% green and 100% blue. In CMYK however, it is, 32.9% cyan, 100% magenta, 0% yellow and 0% black.

* When considering accessibility in web sites would this color be problematic? Explain what should be considered.
* When considering accessibility in web sites, I personally don't think it would be problematic. However, according to the website there is a different, yet very similar, websafe color
of #9900ff that could be a better alternative.
# Logic Gates and circuits

* Explain what is meant by a truth table and apply your knowledge to a NAND gate.
* A truth table provides every possible input to get the output. The input will either be true or false and depending on which one, the output can vary.

* How does the NAND gate truth table compare to that of an AND gate?
* The NAND gate truth table has positive logic inputs and negative logic outputs. The AND gate has positive logic inputs and positive logic outputs.

* Complete the logic gate exercises word doc and upload to this folder.

# IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
* Explain the purpose of IEEE and the importance of ethics in device design
* The purpose of IEEE is to make advancements in technology for all of humanity. Ethics are important in device design because they help keep products simple to use for everyone. 

# Conclusion
* Explain what you learnt from this lab
* I became more familiar with hexadecimal color representation and IEEE.
